This is a simple example of optimal experiment design (OED) for church programs. 
The example computes the expected KL-divergence between the posterior and prior 
model belief distributions given an input. 

There are three models, which generate the distribution for outputs from the
enumerated list {0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9}, given two inputs, a symbolic input
from {alpha, beta, gamma, delta} and a binary value {0,1}. These models only
differ in two ways:
  - model definition: The multinomial distributions within each church program
                      is unique. It is important that the query value for all 
                      the models are identical, but the model definitions and
                      conditions may vary between models.
  - query type : For illustrative purposes, each model uses a different query 
                 type. model_0 uses mh-query with 1000 samples and a lag of 20,
                 model_1 uses enumeration-query, and model_2 uses 
                 rejection-query with 1000 samples. It is important to define
                 the query type in the OED example as it requires different
                 parsers.

To execute the program, run:
> python test.py
